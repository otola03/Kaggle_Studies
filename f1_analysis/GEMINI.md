### Purpose of this project
The purpose is to perform exploratory data analysis, use visualizations to uncover trends and relationships among variables, and apply statistical methods.

### Preferences
I use Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. Prioritize using seaborn. I like my visualizations clean and with skyblue colors. 

### Data
The data I am interested in is those from year 2001~2024.
