# Regression Model Ideas for F1 Data

Here are some ideas for applying linear and logistic regression models to the Formula 1 dataset.

### 1. Linear Regression Ideas (Predicting a Continuous Value)

Linear regression is ideal for predicting a numerical outcome.

**Idea: Predict a Driver's Final Race Position**

This model aims to predict the exact finishing position of a driver in a race.

*   **Target Variable (Y):**
    *   `positionOrder` from `results.csv`. This is a clean numerical rank.

*   **Potential Predictor Variables (X):**
    *   **`grid`** (from `results.csv`): A driver's starting position. This is likely the most powerful predictor.
    *   **`constructorId`** (from `results.csv`): The team's performance is a huge factor.
    *   **`driverId`** (from `results.csv`): The individual skill of the driver.
    *   **Qualifying Times** (`q1`, `q2`, `q3` from `qualifying.csv`): These provide more granular detail than just the final grid position.
    *   **`circuitId`** (from `races.csv`): Some teams/drivers perform better at specific tracks.
    *   **Pit Stop Data** (average `duration` or number of `stop`s from `pit_stops.csv`): Pit stop efficiency can win or lose a race.

*   **Data Preparation Steps:**
    1.  **Merge Datasets:** Create a single master DataFrame by merging `results.csv` with `races.csv`, `qualifying.csv`, and `constructors.csv`.
    2.  **Feature Engineering:** Create new features, such as the average pit stop time for a driver in a given race.
    3.  **Handle Categorical Data:** Convert `constructorId`, `driverId`, and `circuitId` into a numerical format using one-hot encoding.
    4.  **Clean Data:** Handle any missing values.

### 2. Logistic Regression Ideas (Predicting a Categorical Outcome)

Logistic regression is used to predict a binary outcome (e.g., Yes/No).

**Idea: Predict a Podium Finish**

This model predicts whether a driver will finish in the top 3.

*   **Target Variable (Y):**
    *   Create a new binary column, `is_podium`. This would be **1** if `results.positionOrder` is 1, 2, or 3, and **0** otherwise.

*   **Potential Predictor Variables (X):**
    *   The predictors would be largely the same as for the linear regression model: `grid`, `constructorId`, `driverId`, qualifying times, etc.

**Another Idea: Predict a DNF (Did Not Finish)**

This model predicts whether a driver will fail to finish a race.

*   **Target Variable (Y):**
    *   Create a new binary column, `is_dnf`. Use `status.csv` to identify which `statusId` values correspond to non-finishing statuses (e.g., accidents, mechanical failures). Set `is_dnf` to **1** for those statuses and **0** for all "Finished" statuses.

*   **Potential Predictor Variables (X):**
    *   **`grid`**: Starting further back may correlate with more incidents.
    *   **`constructorId`**: Some cars are historically more or less reliable.
    *   **`circuitId`**: Some tracks are known for having more retirements.
    *   **`driverId`**: Some drivers may be more prone to incidents.

| Model Type          | Question to Answer                        | Target Variable (Y)                 | Example Predictors (X)                |
| :------------------ | :---------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------- | :------------------------------------ |
| **Linear Regression** | What position will a driver finish in?    | `results.positionOrder`             | `grid`, `constructorId`, `q1`, `q2`, `q3` |
| **Logistic Regression**| Will a driver finish on the podium?       | `is_podium` (1 if pos <= 3, else 0) | `grid`, `constructorId`, `driverId`   |
| **Logistic Regression**| Will a driver fail to finish the race?    | `is_dnf` (1 if not "Finished", else 0) | `circuitId`, `constructorId`, `grid`  |
