## About Me

I am a data enthusiast with a passion for motorsports, particularly Formula One. My journey into data science began with a curiosity to understand the intricate strategies and predictive analytics that drive success in high-stakes racing. After completing foundational coursework in statistics and machine learning, I have begun applying these concepts to real-world datasets, starting with a comprehensive analysis of Formula One data. My goal is to continue to develop my skills in machine learning and artificial intelligence.
